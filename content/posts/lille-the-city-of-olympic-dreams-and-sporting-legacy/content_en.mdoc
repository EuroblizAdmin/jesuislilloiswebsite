Lille, a vibrant city in northern France, once aimed to host the 2004 Olympics, showcasing its ambition and potential. Now, Lille is a key venue for the 2024 Paris Olympics, hosting basketball and handball events at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. This modern stadium, named after the city’s former mayor and prime minister Pierre Mauroy, symbolizes Lille’s continued commitment to sports and its rich heritage.

The Stade Pierre-Mauroy, built in 2012, is a modular multi-sports showcase with a spectacular design. Located in Villeneuve-d’Ascq, it enables the Hauts de France region and the European Metropolis of Lille, the country’s fourth largest city area, to benefit from an outstanding facility that can host a range of cultural and sporting events throughout the year. The stadium includes a range of technological innovations, including a roof that enables the venue to switch from an open stadium to a closed facility in just 30 minutes.

Lille’s Olympic aspirations are deeply intertwined with the legacy of Pierre Mauroy. Mauroy, who served as the mayor of Lille from 1973 to 2001 and as the Prime Minister of France from 1981 to 1984, played a significant role in the development and modernization of Lille. His vision and leadership were instrumental in Lille’s bid for the 2004 Olympics, and his name is now immortalized in the city’s premier sports venue.

The Stade Pierre-Mauroy hosted the basketball and handball competitions during the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. From July 27 to August 11, 2024, the stadium became the arena for 52 high-level matches, hosting the men’s and women’s basketball preliminary phases, as well as the women’s and men’s handball final phases. This is a testament to Lille’s enduring spirit and dedication to excellence, as well as a celebration of Pierre Mauroy’s legacy.

Beyond the Olympic events, the Stade Pierre-Mauroy will continue to be an ultramodern venue enabling communities across Lille to benefit from a modular complex that can host sports and cultural events all year round. This includes the home matches of Lille Olympique Sporting Club (LOSC), international competitions for several sports, and concerts by global stars.

As the world turns its eyes to Paris in 2024, Lille once again stand proud, showcasing its sporting prowess and honoring the legacy of Pierre Mauroy. The city’s journey from a hopeful Olympic bidder to a key host city is a testament to its resilience, ambition, and commitment to sports and culture.
